        About Console:
        1. The console can be accessed by right-clicking a website and inspecting it, you then go to the console tab.
        2. The console will check for any errors like a debugging system, it can also be used to check things logged in the website with the "console.log" tag.
        3. You can log something in the console by typing the following code: console.log(anything that you want in this) ex: console.log(i am a good coder).
